        <div class="child">
            Considering the ‘digital-native’ background of young Chinese artists, if only viewing digital photos of Zhao Dongfang’s paintings 
            through an electronic screen, it’s easy to mistake them for oil reproductions of nostalgic images widely circulated on the internet. 
            Only when standing in the exhibition space, face to face with the works, can one immediately sense their distinct intent through 
            the tangible, even slightly obstinate materiality and layered reality.
             <br><br>
             At first glance, the photos depict empty rooms: glossy tiles, elegant modern tables and chairs, vintage fans and chandeliers, 
             curtains and blinds, fresh flowers and food, water droplets still clinging on faucets and cutlery. Strangely, electronic 
             screens and communication devices are rarely present. These objects—ordinary domestic items from the lives of white middle-class 
             suburban families in the 1950s-70s—are stripped of traces of human use and textual codes. They are bathed in soft light 
             and subdued tones, overlaid with simulated wear or scratches that evoke a nostalgic, melancholic glow of time passed. It 
             feels as though the viewer is being drawn back into the irretrievable “golden age” of an old music video.
             <br><br>

        <div class="child">
            Stepping into the physical space, the paintings are presented at nearly life-size proportions. Seeming placed at the wrong height, 
            they hang like stand-ins for furniture, positioned as though in place of their prototypes. The blending of real sunlight and 
            perspective creates the illusion of a theater set in which human roles have exited. Despite the framing angles resembling casual, 
            first-person snapshots, the paintings clearly prioritize the painterly elements of light, brushwork, and texture rather than 
            mimicking the flat, smooth, pixelated digital image effects. From the sides of the frames, the layering of paint conveys a 
            tactile sense of materiality. Zhao’s industrious process, involving silkscreens and stencils, results in surfaces with understated 
            and ambiguous textures that surpass the look of old photographs. He is neither committed to material simulations of aging nor 
            inclined toward the exaggerated rendering and collage typical of digital filters. His works adhere to a form not entirely "pure 
            painting" yet remain steadfastly within its boundaries.
            <br><br>
            Indeed, this is a house covered in the dust of time's passage—not to summon virtual empathy in the style of a cyber-patina but to 
            create a prism where the outsider’s gaze pries through reality’s dense fog, inviting every visitor to project their memories onto 
            its stage.

        <div class="subtitle"><strong>Retrospective Drawing</strong></div>
        <div class="child">
            Zhao Dongfang is not a “social media painter” that uses traditional manual painting to counter digital media and asserts that “observing 
            screens is the most crucial reality of our time.” Nor does he rely on the internet for reference. The objects and scenes he paints are 
            rooted in personal experiences from his time as a student in the United States—encounters with street scenes, rented homes, or vacation 
            lodgings. These spaces hold the ordinary, nameless lives and memories of others. Yet his process isn’t immediate. Zhao uses photographs 
            and notes to aid memory, gradually crafting his works in the studio, making retrospective, recollective drawings.
             <br><br>
            The expansive canvases and eye-level compositions construct windows that vividly recall on-site sensations. The interval between initial 
            experience and the painting action allows him to distill and refine the overwhelming immediacy of perception. His standardized process of 
            layering and texturing allows the works' underlying structures to gradually surface. This distance, coupled with the artist’s adherence 
            to routine, lends the paintings a shared tranquility. At first glance, they might resemble the detachment, blurriness, and typification 
            of digital images. On closer inspection, each work reveals its genesis in the light and shadow of a specific fleeting moment—be it the 
            boundary between fog and light at night, the metallic sheen along a chair’s contour, or the repeated rhythms of bottle opener and violin. 
            These details hint at unresolved narrative: a window about to shatter, a door on the verge of closing.   <br><br>

        <div class="child">
            For minds burdened by diminished optimism and overwhelming digital overload, the illusion of a life from a bygone era of prosperity 
            carries a sense of comfort. Especially when such abundant, tangible visual memories are preserved; even the imperfection of old media 
            serve as evidence. With rapidly evolving digital imaging tools and platforms, the affluent, clean, and leisurely middle-class life 
            of the past may now be difficult to attain. Yet a single tap on a smartphone to apply a nostalgic filter is undeniably far more effortless 
            than what the painters of that time could have achieved.
              <br><br>
              In contrast, Zhao Dongfang’s labor-intensive process merely distills the quiet moments that subtly moved him. He does not pursue 
              precise reproduction, emotional expression, or playful engagement with the effects and dissemination of digital imagery. Moreover, 
              Zhao’s “recollection” of his painted subjects is based purely on imagination. It is as though he treats his subjects as raw materials, 
              uses their seemingly formulaic impressions as deliberate contrasts. In the end, the scattered bubbles and glimmers that emerge on 
              the surface are the truest reflections of his gaze. As a viewer, you, too, are invited to join this retrospective process, becoming 
              aware of your own perspective in the act of observing his work.
             <br><br>

        <div class="subtitle"><strong>The Lamenated Stage</strong></div>
            <div class="child">
            Beyond its observational foundation, Zhao’s work is characterized by a defining external layer—an outer shell of oil glaze and 
            textural effects, applied after the painting is complete. This layer functions as a shell, much like the plastic wrap or packing 
            before products are shipped out.

                   <br><br>
                   Zhao Dongfang has always been interested in industrializing the painting process. His works are often placed flat before 
                   it has completely dried. The final layer of paint is diffused through a silk screen, slowly drying over time. Through this
                   method, the texture of silk and patterns made by stencil are reproduced on the surface of the painting, presenting a texture 
                   similar to chemicals eroding the surface of film during development.
  <br><br>
  </div>

   <div class="subtitle"> 
    <img src="./JPG/squooshed/gallery/2024秋冬艺术98233.jpg">
</div>
  <div class="child">
    There’s an intriguing contradiction in Zhao’s approach: while employing methods akin to industrial printing, he uses traditional oil 
    paint, creating a unified, highly integrated surface instead of disjointed or replicated imagery. Rejecting the efficiency and expressive 
    capabilities of silkscreen printing, Zhao instead uses it as an oversized brush, applying a single, sweeping gesture that encapsulates 
    the entire piece. This intense physical act—a gamble on timing, materials, and texture—is both exhilarating and a crystallization of 
    multiple perspectives and distances.

    <br><br>

    Zhao embraces the notion of “the death of the author." Painting, after all, lacks the theatricality of other art forms. Instead, he 
    lets the work transcend the artist’s unilateral control, unlocking the potential for an impersonal, dramatic narrative. Viewers are 
    invited to perform their own interpretations on this stage, devoid of actors, bound only by the framed distance that protects their 
    freedom. Just as creases and bubbles in plastic wrap refract countless tiny lights and reflections, the dust-covered house may be an 
    empty shell, yet it is a lens to glimpse oneself.<br><br></div>

                <div class="child">
                    If the above reasoning holds true, we are inevitably drawn to the fundamental question behind these paintings: How 
                    does a Han Chinese male artist, born in 2002 in Beijing and now living in the east coast United States as a student, 
                    approach the depiction of such archetypal white, middle-class homes? In this precarious era of populist resurgence 
                    and social division, why does he not turn to narratives more directly aligned with his own immediate situation—the 
                    more urgent, "unique" narrative of the present reality? Perhaps, as the artist’s name suggests in its cultural resonance: 
                    The Red Star Shines light to the east. After all, the east of East Asia leads to America.
                     <br><br>
                     Whether in Beijing or the United States, Zhao, like many "ordinary Chinese international students" of his generation, 
                     harbors a detached attitude toward the domestic styles and lifestyles of the previous generation of white, middle-class 
                     Americans. He neither identifies with, envies, nor disdains them, but he is certainly not unfamiliar with them. 
                     Born after the birth of internet, such images had been recycled endlessly—through American films and TV shows, faux 
                     "American-style" furniture ads, or generic image templates of uncertain origin—as a "modern family archetype." They 
                     became part of a universalized impression that extended beyond the concept of "America." This is the somewhat outdated 
                     yet respectable vision of "modern, decent living." 
                       <br><br>

                <div class="child">
                    Zhao has previously engaged with his identity as a Chinese immigrant in his work, including sketches and studies of 
                    life in Chinese senior homes in immigrant neighborhoods, listening to lives marked by loneliness and alienation 
                    despite financial security. Compared to the nuanced struggles of immigrant communities, middle-class luxury apartments 
                    represent a familiar yet hollow archetype of the "American happy family"—a template of stability that remains 
                    aspirational even as real life in these homes is often messier than advertisements suggest. In times of economic 
                    downturn, these spaces become imbued with a melancholic nostalgia for a lost way of life.
                    
                 <br><br>
                 Zhao seems to accept his temporary status as a visitor or tourist, facing these archetypes head-on through his research of 
                 3D-scanned spaces on real estate apps and gathering material during home viewings or travels. The non-residential, transient 
                 nature of short-term rentals—regularly emptied and cleaned—allows them to remain free of the clutter and grime of daily life, 
                 preserving their purity as conceptual spaces. Through his subtle distortions of nostalgic imagery, Zhao critiques the 
                 artificiality of such consumption but also respects the genuine sincerity in people’s projections onto these illusions. 
                 Time erases all, and Zhao embraces this as a form of authenticity. Rather than simply replicating a correct critique, he 
                 chooses to view these spaces with the naive, unencumbered gaze of a passerby, layering fleeting impressions into something 
                 vivid and enigmatic. As viewers adopt the wandering eyes of a visitor, they naturally begin to dismantle and reflect on the 
                 illusions presented.

                Occasionally, his works reveal subtle, "non-white" traces—an origami crane, a defrosting slab of meat, a bloodshot bull’s-eye 
                (“bullseye” in English, both a target and literal term) (the translator has kept the original annotation). These fragments 
                evoke associations: a drawer belonging to a Japanese tenant, the aching wrist of a Mexican housekeeper, a solitary drink of 
                frustration, a supermarket’s clearance sale. These elements, marked by strikingly unsettling hues, are embedded within the 
                vacant rooms, cutting through their sterile facades and bleeding raw, writhing reality into the scene.<br><br>

                The rear window hangs ajar in the breeze. As we step in, a silent, open stage; one step away, a prism that refracts the world.
