            Considering the "post-2000" generation of Chinese artists as digital natives, it is easy to mistake Zhao Dongfang's 
            paintings (viewed through digital photographs) as oil paintings copying nostalgic lifestyle images widely circulated 
            online. Only when facing the paintings in person, with the naked eye, does one immediately sense a completely different
             intention in the materiality, persistence, and layered reality of the works.
             <br><br>
            At first glance, in the photographs, the empty rooms, smooth tiles, elegant modern furniture, retro fans and chandeliers,
             curtains and blinds, fresh flowers and food, water droplets still lingering on faucets and cutlery... are depicted with 
             barely any traces of electronic screens or communication devices. These everyday household objects—evoking the relaxed 
             lifestyles of white, middle-class families in the West during the 1950s-1970s—have been stripped of signs of human use 
             and textual codes. Bathed in soft light and muted colors, they are coated with simulated scratches and "traces of time," 
             dissolving into an international standard of nostalgic melancholy, as if pulling viewers into an irrevocable "beautiful 
             past" from the music video of an old song—though most audiences have never experienced such a past in their own homes.

            However, when entering the physical space, one discovers that each painting is rendered at a one-to-one scale with the 
            actual objects depicted. They are hung as if in their original apartment positions and heights, creating visual misalignments 
            with the walls and assembling a domestic theater abandoned by human actors. While the viewpoints often resemble casual snapshots 
            taken with a camera, the compositions are clearly more concerned with light, texture, and painterly qualities than with replicating 
            the flat, smooth, pixelated digital imagery in electronic colors. From the side of the canvas, the layered coatings reveal the 
            materiality of the medium. The process involves screen-printing and stenciling, creating a surface texture more restrained 
            and ambiguous than film degradation. The artist does not aim for material simulation or artificially exaggerated effects like 
            digital filters; instead, he adheres to a not-so-"pure painting" approach that remains firmly within the realm of "painting."
            <br><br>
            This is indeed a dust-laden room preserving the passage of time, but it does not evoke cyber patina for virtual empathy. 
            Rather, it is a prism formed by the accumulated gaze of an outsider piercing through the fog of reality, expected to serve 
            as a stage for each individual to reimagine their memories.

        <div class="subtitle">Retrospective Drawing</div>
        <div class="child">
            Zhao Dongfang is not a so-called "media-oriented painter" who claims that "painting screens is painting the most important 
            reality of the present," nor does he aim to counter digital media with traditional handmade painting. He doesn’t even use 
            the internet to gather images or image-editing software for reference. The objects and scenes he has painted in recent years 
            all originate from his personal experiences as an international student in the United States, such as fleeting street views, 
            rented apartments, and encounters in tourist lodgings, carrying ordinary and unknown lives and memories. However, his works 
            are not created as immediate sketches but emerge through a process of retrospection, aided by photographs and notes, once he
             returns to the studio. This could be termed a "retrospective form of sketching."
             <br><br>
            The one-to-one scale of his canvases matches the actual size of the objects he depicts, and his compositions align with the perspective
            of the human eye at the scene, creating a vivid sense of immediacy. By starting the painting process after thoroughly reflecting on the
            present moment, he allows time for selecting, refining, and layering the complex impressions of the moment. This is paired with a 
            systematic and stepwise painting process, enabling the underlying structures to gradually filter through and emerge. As an outsider,
            Zhao’s sense of distance and his adherence to near-mechanical processes give his works an overall tranquil appearance, striking a 
            balance between simplicity and subtle dynamism. At first glance, they may seem somewhat akin to digital images—detached, blurry, and 
            generic. On closer inspection, however, each painting reveals itself to originate from a different interplay of light and shadow, born
                of distinct perceptual pathways: the division of light haze in the night, the metallic sheen flowing across chair lines, or the 
             rhythmic repetition between a bottle opener and a violin. These details hint at unresolved narrative moments, 
            such as glass about to shatter or a door on the verge of closing.   <br><br>

        <div class="child">
            In an age when disillusionment with reality and information overload dominate, the nostalgic illusions of an "authentic 
            ife" from an optimistic era undeniably provide comfort—especially as they leave behind so many vivid and credible visual
             memories. The flawed visual effects of old media have even become evidence of their authenticity. The rapid iteration 
             of electronic imaging tools and online dissemination platforms has greatly enhanced the public's ability to mass-produce
              simulated memories. Though the prosperous, clean, and leisurely lives of the middle class are increasingly out of reach, 
              the act of applying nostalgic filters to photos with a simple click is far more convenient than the painstaking efforts 
              of painters and photographers of the past. It has now become a part of contemporary leisure.
              <br><br>
            In contrast, Zhao Dongfang’s retrospective sketching feels laborious and old-fashioned, rooted in distilling the fleeting moments that
             quietly moved him when stepping into unfamiliar empty rooms. His works neither seek to meticulously replicate the physical form 
             of reality nor fully express his personal emotional memories, nor do they toy with digital photography or image dissemination. 
             After all, Zhao’s "reminiscence" of the objects he paints is purely based on imagination. He resembles more of a wandering 
             outsider from a diffe      rent culture, subtly disrupting stereotypes with his incomprehension of typical environments and reimagining 
            a hazy yet open interface of reality for audiences to explore independently. The objects he paints are like raw materials, their 
             apparent stereotypical qualities acting as a deliberate foil. His systematic painting process resembles distillation, with the final
             scattered bubbles and specks of light emerging from the surface representing the reality he has glimpsed with his own eyes. And 
             as the viewer of his paintings, you are also invited to join this act of retrospection and become aware of your own gaze.
             <br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">The Lamenated Stage</div>
            <div class="child">
                Beyond the "retrospective on-site" sketching process, one of the most distinctive features of Zhao Dongfang's paintings in 
                terms of appearance and technique is that, after painting the subject with brushes, he often applies a layer of oil over 
                the surface while it is still wet, using tools such as silk screens and stencils. This process creates a sealed outer membrane
                 and a finely controlled texture, resembling the plastic wrapping or packaging of a product before it is shipped. For artists
                  with diverse educational backgrounds, including visual design, combining other contrasting drafting materials and techniques
                   into handmade painting has become a kind of fashionable way to "slightly break the traditional boundaries of painting."
                   <br><br>
                Zhao Dongfang has always been fascinated by the industrialized production processes that emphasize procedure. In his painting process, he 
typically lays the canvas flat and allows the oil to seep through the silk screen onto the surface. As the canvas and silk screen come into
 contact and gradually dry, the traces of the silk screen and stencil patterns are replicated onto the painting. This process demands 
 patience, a deep familiarity with oil-based media, a mastery of color transparency and layering, and meticulous control over the final
  result. Sometimes, the wet image on the canvas interacts with the layer of color applied through the silk screen, producing a texture 
  reminiscent of film corroded by chemicals during development.
  <br><br>
  </div>

   <div class="subtitle"> 
    <img src="./JPG/2024秋冬艺术98233.jpg">
</div>
  <div class="child">
There’s an intriguing contradiction in Zhao’s approach: while employing tools and processes from industrial printing, he uses traditional 
oil-based materials instead of more varied industrial pigments, and the final effect is a seamlessly integrated whole rather than layered 
assemblies. Ultimately, he produces a unique, thick, and non-replicable oil painting. The dramatic effects and production efficiency 
potential of silk-screen printing are extravagantly abandoned. It’s as if the artist merely borrows the tools of industrial printing 
to complete the massive, intricate strokes of a single brush, covering the entire canvas. This sustained physical engagement, suspending
 oneself over the artwork and taking risks with difficult-to-control elements such as touch, paint, bubbles, time, and texture—all in a 
 single stroke—is exhilarating. Beyond the excitement of the technical challenge, it also crystallizes multiple perspectives and distances.
 <br><br>
When the artist returns to the studio to paint, he already begins with a certain temporal and spatial distance, filtering through the 
immediate sensations of the scene at various scales and perspectives in his memory. He encapsulates the sharp yet indefinable elements 
within the relatively fixed compositional perspective of a photograph. The composition of his paintings is singular, and the intention 
is ambiguous. Objects remain in a state of latent momentum, as if events are about to unfold. The long-exposure quality of light and 
motion appears fluid and continuous, forming a space open for free exploration. The silk screen stage introduces another layer of 
distance, this time adopting an overhead, surveying perspective. The procedural application of oil and texture sets walls and faint 
details within this open space, like old photographs pressed under a glass tabletop, suggesting the distance of time past. The personal
 brushstrokes and emotions of the artist are also smoothed away. The memory of the scene from that day blends with a longer-reaching 
 imagination of the original owners’ lives ("idyllic times" that seem both typical and questionable). Objects, scenes, paintings, and
  people transform from representations into traces. Using a tangible, relatable sense of everyday familiarity as the entry point, two
   seemingly similar yet fundamentally opposing pasts expose each other further. This dynamic turns into a stage, inviting viewers to 
   place themselves within the scene, not to recount the stories of the house or its era, but to articulate their own inner thoughts.
   <br><br>

Zhao Dongfang enjoys believing in the notion that "the author is dead." After all, painting is inherently a task devoid of "grand 
performances." Instead, he prefers to let his works escape the unilateral control of their creator, designing them to guide viewers 
into expressing their own interpretations and imaginations on this shared stage. The delineated boundaries of encapsulation preserve
 the viewer's freedom. Just as the folds and bubbles in plastic packaging refract countless tiny glimmers and act as lenses, reflecting 
 the viewer’s potential gaze and their own image in the mirror, perhaps the dust-covered house is nothing more than a hollow sandcastle 
 with only its dusty surface left behind.<br><br></div>

                <div class="child">
                    If the above reasoning holds, one cannot help but wonder about a fundamental question behind the artwork: as a Han 
                    Chinese male born in Beijing in 2004, who only moved to the U.S. East Coast for study, what perspective and attitude 
                    does Zhao Dongfang adopt in portraying these overly stereotypical white middle-class homes? On the uneasy eve of 
                    populism's resurgence and ethnic divides, why doesn't he focus on realities that are more relevant, urgent, or 
                    "unique" to his own situation? Perhaps it is, as his name's phonetic resemblance suggests: "The Red Star Illuminates
                     the East" or "You too deserve the surname Zhao," as the East of East Asia leads further eastward to North America.
                     <br><br>
                    Whether in Beijing or the U.S., Zhao Dongfang clearly does not share the material conditions or cultural background 
                    associated with the furniture and architectural styles in his paintings. Like most of his peers among "ordinary 
                    Chinese international students," he seems indifferent, neither envious nor resentful—perhaps mildly curious at some
                     point but never unfamiliar. For a generation born after the globalization of the internet, these images have long
                      been filtered countless times as the "standard portrait of modern families" in numerous childhood online images,
                       Western films and TV shows, faux "American-style" furniture ads, and borrowed image templates. They have even 
                       become part of a universal impression that transcends America itself—a somewhat outdated portrayal of "modern 
                       people's decent lives." Needless to say, they are so pervasive in American art education and popular visual 
                       culture that one has no choice but to patiently try to understand them.
                       <br><br>

                <div class="child">
                Zhao Dongfang has previously engaged in projects based on his identity as a Chinese/Chinese-American living in the U.S., 
                such as visiting and sketching the real lives of residents in Chinese community nursing homes, listening to their stories 
                of secure but lonely and isolated lives. Compared to the tangled circumstances of immigrant groups, upscale middle-class 
                apartments represent a stable yet hollow "template of American happiness" familiar to everyone. Although life after purchase
                 is not always as clean and joyful as advertisements suggest, these homes often evoke nostalgic emotions of decline and vacancy among the mainstream population during economic downturns.
                 <br><br>
                Zhao Dongfang might first have accepted his temporary identity as a visitor or tenant to confront these settings directly,
                 conducting research through spatial scanning models on real estate apps and gathering inspiration during house tours and 
                 travels. It is precisely the transient, periodically emptied nature of short-term rentals that avoids the clutter and grime
                  of everyday life, preserving these spaces in their conceptual purity. From the subtle disturbances that parallel nostalgic
                   imagery, one can glimpse the artist’s implicit critique of such illusory consumption, while also recognizing people’s 
                   genuine emotions projected onto illusions and the inexorable passing of time. Rather than copying a correct critique, 
                   he prefers to escape the fixed perspectives and preconceived notions of issues and positions, using the naïve gaze of 
                   a passerby to interweave moments that are vivid yet elusive. When viewers, like wandering visitors, trace clues and 
                   uncover secrets in the paintings with their eyes, the illusion is naturally broken and reexamined.

                <div class="empty"></div>
                Occasionally, a few not-so-"purely white" traces can be found in the paintings: East Asian origami cranes, 
                a wet slab of meat, a bloodshot bullseye (both in English: “bullseye”), evoking the drawer of a Japanese tenant
                 family, the sore wrist of a Mexican domestic worker, a solitary and angry drinking session, or a discounted 
                 near-expiry supermarket deal. Embedded in the continually receding empty rooms with vivid, unsettling colors, 
                 these fragments carve out cracks and seep into the untouched, heated, writhing reality.

                The back window is always half-ajar in the wind. When we step inside, it is a silently open stage. When we step 
                away, it becomes a lens for gazing back at the world.
